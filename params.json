You can also [view and fork the guide](https://gist.github.com/4042624) right here on Github.\r\n\r\nStart your OpenStack setup by installing Ubuntu Server 12.04LTS on the servers you want included in your OpenStack cluster.  OpenStack can be installed on a single computer and nodes may be added at a later date to increase instance hosting capacity.\r\n\r\nLogin to your box via ssh and install *git* with *aptitude*. We'll become root and do an update first:\r\n\r\n    aptitude update\r\n    apt-get install git\r\n\r\nNow checkout the StackGeek OpenStack setup scripts from Github:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/StackGeek/openstackgeek.git\r\n    cd openstackgeek/folsom\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n#Srapsware (P) LTD\r\n**Shiv Singh kushwaha**\r\nshiv@srapsware.com\r\n","name":"Srapsware Openstack"}
